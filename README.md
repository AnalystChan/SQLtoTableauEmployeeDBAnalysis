# SQL to Tableau Employee DB Analysis
A project to create tables using Employees DB in SQL Lite and then exporting task specific queries into Tableau for visualization.

# Overview
The employee database contains about 300,000 employee records with 2.8 million salary entries. The export data is 167 MB, which is not huge, but heavy enough to be non-trivial for testing. Imported this db into SQL Lite and then created queries for some tasks and then imported results into Tableau to create interactive visualizations.
